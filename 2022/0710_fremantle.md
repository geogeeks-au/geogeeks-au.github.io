Social Mapping Sunday - the Fremantle edition! We’re planning a day of surveying the area and indoor desktop mapping.
Tips and tricks to be shared throughout!

Join us at 9:30am for a coffee, morning tea and a chat at Il Cibo cafe. We'll devise a plan for the morning:
to include surveying/data collecting in the area and desktop mapping at our meeting room. Finally, we will reconvene for lunch somewhere.

Meet at Il Cibo cafe, 2 Market St, Fremantle (opposite the train station). Later we’ll meet again 49 Phillimore St, Fremantle.

All skill levels welcome! Bring your favourite mapping equipment - laptop, tablet, phone, or nothing at all!
We have tools and techniques to share for easy and effective surveying and desktop mapping.
