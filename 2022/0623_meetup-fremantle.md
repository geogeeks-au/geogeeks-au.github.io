We're back! We're reinstating regular geospatial community meetups. Starting in Fremantle!

This is a casual free meetup for anyone who's interested in mapping, spatial data, remote sensing, OpenStreetMap, QGIS, geospatial Python, PostGIS and anything in between.
Bring your projects, questions and suggestions, and come meet some like-minded people.
It will be a friendly and relaxed evening, and you can hear more about what we have planned for Geogeeks and FOSS4G Perth.
All are welcome!

* Where: 49 Phillimore St, Fremantle. (We will email registered attendees with building entry details before the date).
* Refreshments: will be provided.

We have to cap the number of attendees, so please register! We look forward to seeing you there!
