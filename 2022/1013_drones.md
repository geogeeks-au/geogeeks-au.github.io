Join us for an evening of talks and skill sharing with the Perth open geospatial community!

We’ll be guided through drone setup, data capture and data processing using OpenDroneMap by experienced drone operator, Grant Boxer.
Don’t miss this opportunity to ask all your drone questions!

Ben Ritter will share tips on approaching OpenStreetMap as a powerful database,
including querying with Overpass QL tools (within QGIS or via http).
Come learn about OSM as more than just a base map!

This is a relaxed free evening for anyone who's interested in open geospatial tools, open data and open source projects.
Come to learn something new, share ideas and gather some tips! There’ll be plenty of time to chat over drinks and pizza.

Our speakers are:

* *Grant Boxer:* Drone setup, data capture and processing in OpenDroneMap
* *Ben Ritter:* OpenStreetMap as a database: querying with Overpass QL, populating with a phone

Please register so we can cater well. We look forward to seeing you there!

The Riff doors will lock and the Vault room doesn’t have great phone reception
so message us on the [Geogeeks Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/geogeeks/shared_invite/zt-13fnotoqb-YkyMTmvwZEB_nDUis_30hw)
or [email](mailto:geogeeks.perth@gmail.com) if you can’t get in.
