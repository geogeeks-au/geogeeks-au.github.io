Come for another Perth mapping party, this time starting in Claisebrook for coffee,
and heading through Victoria Gardens and over Matagurup Bridge to the Optus Stadium.
We'll map all that we can find!

Everyone is welcome, no experience necessary.
We'll start the day at a caf√© (meet at [Kinky Lizard](http://www.kinkylizard.com.au/kinky-lizard-og/))
and then explore for a couple of hours (in groups or all together), before ending up
somewhere else for lunch (location t.b.d. on the day).

Morning tea sponsored by [OSGeo Oceania](https://osgeo-oceania.org/)!
