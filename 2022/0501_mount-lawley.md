Join us at 9:30am for a coffee, morning tea and a chat at the cute little Viaje Coffee.
We'll devise a plan for adding details of the shopping strip to OSM, which we'll execute in small groups. Finally, we will reconvene for lunch somewhere, whoever is keen.

All skill levels welcome! Bring your favourite mapping equipment, just a phone, or nothing at all! We have tools and techniques to share for easy and effective surveying.
