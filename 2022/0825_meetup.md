The plan for the evening includes:

* Tuning in to some [FOSS4G conference presentations](https://2022.foss4g.org/schedule_general.php#2022-08-25) live from Firenze!
* Sharing news about what we’re all working on.
* Comparing our knowledge gaps and wishlists – so Geogeeks can organise some useful workshops and presentation sessions.

We will provide drinks and a large room with desks and a projection screen. Bring a laptop if you wish. All are welcome!

No registration necessary, just meet us there! The Riff doors will lock and the Vault room doesn’t have great phone reception
so message us on the [Geogeeks Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/geogeeks/shared_invite/zt-13fnotoqb-YkyMTmvwZEB_nDUis_30hw)
or [email](mailto:geogeeks.perth@gmail.com) if you can’t get in.
