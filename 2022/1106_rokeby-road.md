Join us for a coffee and an exploration of Rokeby Rd in Subiaco at our next mapping party.

Everyone is welcome, no experience necessary.
We'll start the day at [La Maison Des Eclairs Cafe][1]
then explore for a couple of hours (in groups or all together),
before ending up somewhere else for lunch (location TBD on the day).

Morning tea sponsored by [OSGeo Oceania](https://osgeo-oceania.org/)!

Join the Geogeeks Slack to keep in touch!
