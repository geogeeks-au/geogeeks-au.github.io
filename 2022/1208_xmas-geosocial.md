Join us for a social catchup with the WA open geospatial community.
We’ve had some great Geogeeks meetups this year and we’d love to see everyone once more!

Your first drink is on us, thanks to [Mammoth Geospatial](https://mammothgeospatial.com/) and [OSGeo Oceania](https://osgeo-oceania.org/)!

We have tables booked outside. Come find us and we’ll connect you with a drink! We look forward to seeing you there!

Supported by OSGeo Oceania's grant program and Mammoth Geospatial.

**Update 3PM 8 Dec.*** — Due to a gas leak at Market Grounds, we have moved to The Globe pub on Wellington Street.
