We'll be heading south east for this month's OpenStreetMap mapping party, to explore Mills Park and environs — a short walk from the Beckenham railway station.
It's an area with streams and trails, highways and bike paths, and lots to map!

Meet at 11AM at the [Fika on Brix café](https://www.fikaonbrix.com.au), located in the Mills Park Centre.
We'll start with morning tea there (generously provided by [OSGeo Oceania](https://osgeo-oceania.org))
and a discussion of mapping tools and techniques, before planning how we want to map and heading off in small groups.
No experience is necessary! Bring your phone (and if you're keen, see [our list of recommended apps](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Perth/Social_Mapping_Sunday#Getting_Started) to get some ideas of how to get started).
Alternatively, you might like to print off some [Field Papers](https://fieldpapers.org) for some offline mapping.

We'll meet back at the café for lunch (the kitchen closes at 2 so we'll return before then).

Coordination on the day will be done via [the Geogeeks Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/geogeeks/shared_invite/zt-13fnotoqb-YkyMTmvwZEB_nDUis_30hw).
