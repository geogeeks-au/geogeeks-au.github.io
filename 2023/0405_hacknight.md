Join us for a casual open geospatial hack night! Bring your projects, your challenges and ideas! All skill levels and areas of interest are welcome.

Come to share skills, solve problems and gather inspiration. There's no planned structure and everyone is free to chat (or sit and get something done!).
There'll be people with interests in OpenStreetMap, all things QGIS, data collection and processing, and many other aspects of geospatial.
Bring your laptop/devices if you wish.

Pizza and drinks are provided. Please register so we can cater well :)

The meetup is in the Vault room, so head right to the back of Riff.
Phone reception is bad in the Vault so please
use [Geogeeks Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/geogeeks/shared_invite/zt-13fnotoqb-YkyMTmvwZEB_nDUis_30hw)
or [email](mailto:geogeeks.perth@gmail.com) to reach us if there's no one by the front door.
