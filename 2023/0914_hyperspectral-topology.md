Come join us for a casual evening of short talks from local geospatial practitioners.
This time we'll hear about interesting data analysis approaches within a QGIS environment, and have opportunity to meet fellow open geospatial enthusiasts!
All are welcome.

The speakers are:

* **Grant Boxer:** Hyperspectral satellite data in QGIS
* **Humphrey Boogaerdt:** Using topology for pattern recognition in mineral exploration and alternate approaches to road centrelines
* **Russell Menezes:** From Text to Treasure Map: How Geospatial Natural Language Processing Revolutionizes Mineral Exploration

After the talks we'll hang around to chat over pizza and drinks. The event is free and everyone is welcome, but please register so we can cater well!
