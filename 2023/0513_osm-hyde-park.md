Join us for a coffee and an exploration of Hyde Park and William St or Fitzgerald St on the edge of Northbridge.

Everyone is welcome, no experience necessary. We'll start the day at the
[kiosk on west side of Hyde park](https://www.openstreetmap.org/node/436772767),
then then survey the park or the nearby shopping strips (in groups or all together),
before ending up somewhere else for lunch (location TBD on the day).

Add Points of Interest (POIs) on your phone, draw on a printed map or measure some angles with Sam's homemade theodolite setup
(just for a taste of the Good Old Days). We've got all the materials, come down and learn about OSM.

We'll do a coffee/snack run, sponsored by [OSGeo Oceania](https://wiki.osgeo.org/wiki/Oceania)!

RSVP on [osmcal.org/event/2096](https://osmcal.org/event/2096), [message Ben](https://www.openstreetmap.org/message/new/BudgieInWA) with any questions, and join the
[Geogeeks Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/geogeeks/shared_invite/zt-13fnotoqb-YkyMTmvwZEB_nDUis_30hw) to keep in touch.
