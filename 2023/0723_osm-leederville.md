This month we'll meet for coffee on Oxford Street, and then head to Lake Monger to map the area.

Snacks and coffee at 9:30 at [Cranked Coffee](https://www.cranked.net.au/) (kindly provided by [OSGeo Oceania](https://osgeo-oceania.org)).

Lunch later in the day at a nearby location (t.b.d).

Everyone welcome, no OSM experience necessary!

We'll introduce each other, plan the day, and head off to survey in small groups.
We'll be looking to add all sorts of features to the map, either directly on the day via various mobile apps such as Street Complete and OSM Go, or by taking photos and notes for later mapping when back at a computer.

Coordination on the day will be done via [the Geogeeks Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/geogeeks/shared_invite/zt-13fnotoqb-YkyMTmvwZEB_nDUis_30hw).
