Please join us for a casual evening of short talks about QGIS and open source GIS from the Perth open geospatial community.

It’s time once again for the Perth open geospatial community to gather, swap stories, and hear about what’s happening in the world of open source GIS!

Please join us for a casual evening of short talks, learn something new, share ideas, and meet up with friends old and new. After the talks, we'll hang around to chat over pizza and drinks.

Our speakers are:

* *Tom Lynch:* SimCow 3000—interactive rangelands cattle science with QGIS and GeoPackage
* *Jack Green:* QGIS Plugins for Exploration Geology
* *Khia Emslie-O'Brien:* Our Country Mapping

All are welcome - this is a relaxed free evening for anyone who's interested in open geospatial tools, open data, and open source projects.

The event is free and welcome to all, but please register so we know how many pizzas to order :)

Supported by Spacecubed and OSGeo Oceania's grant program.
