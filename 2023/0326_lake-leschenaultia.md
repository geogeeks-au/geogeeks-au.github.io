For our first [Geogeeks](https://geogeeks.org/) mapping day out in 2023, we're heading to 
[Lake Leschenaultia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Leschenaultia) in the Perth hills!
Everyone's invited, it doesn't matter how familiar you are with OpenStreetMap
— we'll help you get set up with apps, accounts, etc.

Meet at Reflections Café at 10:30 for coffee and to discuss mapping,
then we'll spend a couple of hours mapping the area in small groups, and meet up again for lunch.  

We're organising carpooling, and will pick people up at Midland, Cannington, or Claisebrook stations (and probably elsewhere).
Get in touch if you want a lift.

[Join us on Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/geogeeks/shared_invite/zt-13fnotoqb-YkyMTmvwZEB_nDUis_30hw) to stay up to date,
and to coordinate things. Please RSVP here so we have an idea of numbers (and if you don't want to use Slack,
we'll contact you via the OSM messaging system).
