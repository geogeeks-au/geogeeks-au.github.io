Come join us for another casual open geospatial hack night. Bring your projects, your challenges and ideas!
All skill levels and areas of interest are welcome.

Come to share skills, solve problems and gather inspiration.
There's no planned structure and everyone is free to chat (or sit and get something done!).
There'll be people with interests in OpenStreetMap, all things QGIS, data collection and processing,
and many other aspects of geospatial.

Pizza and drinks are provided. Please register so we can cater well :)

This event is hosted by Geogeeks Perth (find us at [Geogeeks Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/geogeeks/shared_invite/zt-13fnotoqb-YkyMTmvwZEB_nDUis_30hw)
