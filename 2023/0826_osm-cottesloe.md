Let's head to coast for this month's OpenStreetMap day! There are public amenities to update, Whadjuk trails to map, parks and vegetation to capture.

Meet for 9:30 coffee at [Daisies](https://www.daisies.net.au/) (kindly covered by [OSGeo Oceania](https://osgeo-oceania.org)). This is near the Grant St train station and 102 bus route.

We'll introduce each other, plan the day and head off to survey in small groups. 
We'll be adding all sorts of features to the map, either via mobile apps or by taking photos and notes for later mapping on a computer. Plenty of options!

We'll meet again for lunch later in the day at a nearby location (TBD).

Everyone welcome, no OSM experience necessary!

Check out the Easy Mobile Editor apps and other options for OSM editing [listed here](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Perth/Social_Mapping_Sunday#Getting_Started). We can fill you in on the details!

Coordination on the day will be done via [the Geogeeks Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/geogeeks/shared_invite/zt-13fnotoqb-YkyMTmvwZEB_nDUis_30hw).
