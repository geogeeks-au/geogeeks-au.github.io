Let's celebrate another year of Geogeeks! We've had an action packed year of meetups, mapping days, fantastic speakers and sharing all things open geospatial! Now let's catch up over an end of year drink before Geogeeks takes a short break over summer.

We have tables booked outside and a tab at the bar. Come find us and we’ll connect you with a drink!

Shout out on Slack or email if you're struggling to find us. See you there!
