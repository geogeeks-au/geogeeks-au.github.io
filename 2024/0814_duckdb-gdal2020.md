Come for an evening of short talks from local geospatial practitioners.

It's been a while since we lined up an evening of talks, so this author is looking forward to catching up with everyone again, and meeting some new geospatial enthusiasts too. All are welcome.

Speakers:

- **Roger Merritt** - The 3m Accuracy issue transforming to and from GDA2020
- **Jerome Lefebvre** - Merging weather data with Geospatial data using DuckDB
- **You?!?** - Got an interesting geo-related technique, trick, or story that you think we whould know about? Email [geogeeks.perth@gmail.com](mailto:geogeeks.perth@gmail.com) so we can organise a talk!

After the talks we'll hang around to chat over pizza and drinks. The event is free and everyone is welcome, but please register so we can cater well!
