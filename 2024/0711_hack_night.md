For a change, this monthâ€™s Geogeeks hack night is on a Thursday.
*This* Thursday in fact! (Sorry for the late notice.)

It will be another casual open geospatial evening of OpenStreetMap,
QGIS, and maybe some OpenHistoricalMap (for the map warper fans amongst us).
Bring your projects, your challenges and ideas!
All skill levels and areas of interest are welcome.

Pizza and drinks are provided by [OSGeo Oceania](https://osgeo-oceania.org).

This event is hosted by Geogeeks Perth (find us at [Geogeeks Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/geogeeks/shared_invite/zt-13fnotoqb-YkyMTmvwZEB_nDUis_30hw)
or [email](mailto:geogeeks.perth@gmail.com)),
and supported by [OSGeo Oceania](https://osgeo-oceania.org)'s grant program and [Spacecubed](https://spacecubed.com).
