Join us for a coffee and an exploration of [Perth Zoo](https://perthzoo.wa.gov.au/), while they have free tickets (We have purchased 4 tickets).

Everyone is welcome, no experience necessary (or osmcal.org registration).
We'll start the day at [Habitat Cafe][1], then survey the exhibits, before ending back at the Habitat Cafe for lunch.

Add and update Points of Interest (POIs) on your phone, draw on your phone or a printed map. We've got all the materials, come down and learn about OSM (OpenStreetMap).

We'll do a coffee/snack run, sponsored by [OSGeo Oceania][2]!

RSVP on [OSM Calendar](https://osmcal.org/event/3146/), [message Ben][3] with any questions, and [join the Geogeeks Slack][4] to keep in touch.
