Come for an evening of short talks from local geospatial practitioners.

This time we're focused on the GIS journey, featuring stories from students & early career professionals. We'll hear about drones, metadata, and learning QGIS through the eyes of people finding their way into the geospatial community.

And, as always, it's a great opportunity to catch up with friends and meet fellow open geospatial enthusiasts. All are welcome.

Speakers:

- **Yukio Chaplin & River Bali** - Serverless Imagery Processing with OpenDroneMap and AWS
- **Diego Hernández** - Enhancing UAV Metadata Creation in a Reproducible Workflow: Leveraging GeoNetwork for FAIR Principles Implementation
- **Nick Courts** - More Than Just a Job: My Journey into GIS
- **David Galloway** - Using GIS to Map and Apps to Manage Fire Information

After the talks we'll hang around to chat over pizza and drinks. The event is free and everyone is welcome, but please register so we can cater well!
