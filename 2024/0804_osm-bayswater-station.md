Join us for a coffee and an exploration of the new train station and surrounding streets.

Everyone is welcome, no experience necessary (or osmcal.org registration).
We'll start the day at [the Drip Expresso Bar][1], then survey the train station or the nearby shopping strips (in groups or all together), before ending up
somewhere else for lunch (location TBD on the day).

Add and update Points of Interest (POIs) on your phone, draw on your phone or a printed map. We've got all the materials, come down and learn about OSM (OpenStreetMap).

We can also teach you how OSM relations work and how to link objects together for advanced public transport navigation!

We'll do a coffee/snack run, sponsored by [OSGeo Oceania][2]!

[RSVP on osmcal.org](https://osmcal.org/event/3006/), [message Ben][3] with any questions, and [join the Geogeeks Slack][4] to keep in touch.
