Come sneak in one last hack night for the year this Thursday! (Before [EOY drinks](https://geogeeks.org/2024/1212_xmas-geosocial.html) the following Thursday.)

Join us in The Vault (back behind the kitchen) for a beer, bring your projects, and geo-news and let's chat. All skill levels and areas of interest are welcome.

Come to share skills, solve problems and gather inspiration.
There'll be people with interests in OpenStreetMap, all things QGIS, data collection and processing,
and many other aspects of geospatial.

Pizza and drinks are provided by [OSGeo Oceania](https://osgeo-oceania.org).

This event is hosted by Geogeeks Perth (find us at [Geogeeks Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/geogeeks/shared_invite/zt-13fnotoqb-YkyMTmvwZEB_nDUis_30hw)
