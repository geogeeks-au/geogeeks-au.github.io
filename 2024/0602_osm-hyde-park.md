Join us for a coffee and an exploration of the eastern side of Hyde Park. Last year we have mapped the western side, so let's finish mapping the park before some of the beautiful trees need to be felled.

Everyone is welcome, no experience necessary.
We'll start the day at [the kiosk on west side of Hyde park][1], then survey the park or the nearby shopping strips (in groups or all together), before ending up
somewhere else for lunch (location TBD on the day).

Add and update Points of Interest (POIs) on your phone, draw on a printed map. We've got all the materials, come down and learn about OSM.

We'll do a coffee/snack run, sponsored by [OSGeo Oceania][2]!

[Message Ben][3] with any questions, and [join the Geogeeks Slack][4] to keep in touch.
