Join us for a walk by the water, exploring and surveying the Swan River in Ascot for OpenStreetMap. We'll be given coffee, then investigate the new mountain biking track under the Tonkin Hwy bridge and stroll through the nearby Garvey Park adding amenities, paths, shops, and anything else we spot along the way, before sitting down for lunch somewhere.

Meet at 10AM at [The Riverdeck Restaurant & Bar](https://www.swanriverhotel.com.au/restaurant) for coffee (generously provided by [OSGeo Oceania](https://osgeo-oceania.org)) and a discussion of mapping tools and techniques, before planning where we want to map and heading off in small groups.

No experience is necessary! Bring your phone (and if you're keen, see [our list of recommended apps](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Perth/Social_Mapping_Sunday#Getting_Started) to get some ideas of how to get started). Alternatively, you might like to print off some [Field Papers](https://fieldpapers.org) for some offline mapping with pen and paper.

Afterwards, we will grab ourselves some lunch at one of the nearby options.

Coordination on the day will be done via [the Geogeeks Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/geogeeks/shared_invite/zt-13fnotoqb-YkyMTmvwZEB_nDUis_30hw).
