Greetings geogeeks!

Our next hack night is on Thursday, 3rd of March at Spacecubed. We'll be heading upstairs to the 9th floor boardroom.

What's on:

* Getting a bit deeper into PostGIS - for folks interested in learning about this powerful spatial database, we'll spend a bit of time on spatial queries, data loading, and helping new users get past their roadblocks. Even if you're a seasoned PostGIS user, you might be interested in joining in to share your knowledge.
* Pitches - let's get some projects started! We've had a few rumblings of project ideas at the last 2 hack nights (a couple even have GitHub repos!). We're hoping to keep going with the idea generation, bring some of these project ideas into the open air, and get them started. If you have an idea you want to get help with, or want to find out how you can help, this is a good opportunity to do it.

Be aware, the entrance to the building (at 45 St Georges Terrace) will be locked at some point. If you're running a bit late (don't sweat it, drop in any time), contact us and we'll let you in.
