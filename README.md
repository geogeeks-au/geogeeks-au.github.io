## Adding a new event

Event pages should use the `event` layout, with a structure like the following:

```
---
layout: event
title: "Event: Title Here"
start_time: 2023-11-12 17:30
end_time: 2023-11-12 20:00
location:
    name: 
    address: 
    latitude: 
    longitude: 
registration_url: 
commons_category: "Cat name without 'Category:' prefix"
homepage: true
---
Then describe the event here, in Markdown.

```
