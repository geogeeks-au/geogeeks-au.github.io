Join us to explore Mount Hawthorn and survey for OSM, after enjoying a free coffee sponsored by OSGeo Oceania.

Everyone is welcome, no experience is necessary: Just show up with a phone (or pen & paper) and a little enthusiasm.
We'll start the day at [Ginga cafe][cafe], then survey the streets, shops, and parks in small groups, before picking a nice place for lunch.

Add and update Points of Interest (POIs) on your phone, draw on your phone or a printed map. We've got all the materials, come down and learn about OSM (OpenStreetMap). Check out our [getting started page][starting] for pointers.

The morning coffee or drink is sponsored by [OSGeo Oceania][osgeo]!

[Join the Geogeeks Slack][slack] to keep in touch, or [message Ben][msg-ben] with any questions.
