We are taking to the foreshore to map some of the newer features in South Perth.

Meet us for a free coffee (paid for by our sponsor, [OSGeo Oceania][osgeo]) and a chat at [Atomic cafe][cafe]. We'll decide on some routes, then walk around surveying features in small groups, before meeting back for lunch nearby. And probably catch the ferry back to the city after all that.

Everyone is welcome; no mapping experience is necessary. Just bring a phone or tablet or a map to draw on. You will learn about OpenStreetMap (OSM) and how to survey points of interest (POIs) and more! Browse our recommended editors on our [getting started page][osm-start], if you want to.


[Join the Geogeeks Slack][slack] to keep in touch or [message Ben][msg-ben] with any questions.
