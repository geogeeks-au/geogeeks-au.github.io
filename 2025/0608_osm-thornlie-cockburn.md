Come explore and map the brand new Thronlie-Cockburn train link with us on opening day!

Meet us at an espresso machine by Perth Station for a coffee paid for by our sponsor, [OSGeo Oceania][osgeo]! After the meet-and-greet over morning tea, we will ride the train to the new stations to survey and map them in OSM, as well as enjoying the [opening day celebrations][event-new-link]. I hear there are free sausage sizzles, and the trains are free (with a SmartRider) on Sundays.

Everyone is welcome; no mapping experience is necessary. Just bring a phone or tablet or a map to draw on. You will learn about OpenStreetMap (OSM) and how to survey points of interest (POIs) and more!

We'll start the day at [The Shoe Café][cafe] in Yagan Square, then take the train to [Thornlie Station][station-thornlie], [Nicholson Road Station][station-nicholson], [Ranford Station][station-ranford], and [Cockburn Central Station][station-cockburn].

[Join the Geogeeks Slack][slack] to keep in touch or [message Ben][msg-ben] with any questions.
