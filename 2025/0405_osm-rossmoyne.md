The City of Canning has opened up their footpath's dataset; to import the data we want to verify their tagging and suitability for Open Street Map. Join us for a free coffee sponsored by OSGeo Oceania and explore Rossmoyne.

Everyone is welcome, no experience necessary (or osmcal.org registration).
We'll start the day at [Flames Restaurant][1], then survey the streets or the nearby foreshore (in groups or all together), before ending up back at the Flames Restaurant for lunch.

Add and update Points of Interest (POIs) on your phone, draw on your phone or a printed map. We've got all the materials, come down and learn about OSM (OpenStreetMap).

We'll do a coffee/snack run, sponsored by [OSGeo Oceania][2]!

RSVP on [osmcal.org/event/3624](https://osmcal.org/event/3624/), [message Ben][3] with any questions, and [join the Geogeeks Slack][4] to keep in touch.
