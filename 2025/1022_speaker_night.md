Once again, it's time for Geogeeks!

Please join us for an evening of short talks from local geospatial practitioners. We've got a great line up of talks, including some very cool initiatives created right here in Perth.

All are welcome!

Speakers:

- **Nick Wright** - Find and Share Tiles Easily with Sentinel-2 Grid Explorer
    <!-- - <a href="https://maps.budgieinwa.au/presentation.html" target=_blank>slides</a> -->
- **Jeremy Lykke** - Drillhole Data Capture in QGIS
    <!-- - <a href="0402_speaker_night/Impact-Zones-Urban-Development-on-Bushland_H-Boogaerdt_2025_pptx.pdf" target=_blank>slides</a> -->
- **You?** - Your story here!


After the talks we'll hang around to chat over pizza and drinks. The event is free and everyone is welcome, but please register so we can cater well!

Got an interesting geo-related technique, trick, or story about open geospatial you want to share? Email [geogeeks.perth@gmail.com](mailto:geogeeks.perth@gmail.com) so we can organise a talk!
