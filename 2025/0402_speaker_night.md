Once again, it's time for Geogeeks!

Please join us for an evening of short talks from local geospatial practitioners. We've got a great line up of talks, covering OSM imports, urban analysis with QGIS and deep learning, and enterprise-grade Python processing.

All are welcome!

Speakers:

- **Ben Ritter** - Importing to OpenStreetMap
- **Humphrey Boogaerdt** - Urban Development Impact on Bushland: Multi-Criteria Analysis with QGIS
- **Warin Chotirosniramit** - Unravelling urban transformations with deep learning models
- **Nicholas Chai** - Using open-source Python libraries to achieve enterprise-grade geoprocessing, without the enterprise price tag

After the talks we'll hang around to chat over pizza and drinks. The event is free and everyone is welcome, but please register so we can cater well!

Got an interesting geo-related technique, trick, or story about open geospatial you want to share? Email [geogeeks.perth@gmail.com](mailto:geogeeks.perth@gmail.com) so we can organise a talk!
