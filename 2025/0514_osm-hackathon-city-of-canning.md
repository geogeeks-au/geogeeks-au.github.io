Have you been wondering how to [get started][starting] contributing to OSM, or how to get the most our of the tools? At the last Geogeeks meetup, we saw Ben whizzing through some OSM editing; well this your chance to see it in detail and ask questions:

This month at Geogeeks we are hosting an OpenStreetMap workshop and Mapathon using the web-based editor, iD, and the Java based editor, JOSM. We will

- introduce the basics of OSM editing for those who are new,
- deep dive into footpath mapping and tagging,
- and cover the City of Canning in footpaths together!

All skill levels are welcome. Just bring a laptop (and a mouse if possible). Pizza and beers will be provided by our sponsor, [OSGeo Oceania][osgeo].

[Join the Geogeeks Slack][slack] to keep in touch, or [message Ben][msg-ben] with any questions.
