** *The Vault* is located at the rear of Spacecubed, behind the desks.**

Join us for another casual after-work meetup to chat and tinker on your geo-projects! It's been a while, so bring your news and ideas, new and old! All skill levels and areas of interest are welcome.

Come to share skills, solve problems, gather inspiration, and stay connected.
There'll be people with interests in OpenStreetMap, all things QGIS, data collection and processing,
and many other aspects of geospatial.

Pizza and drinks are provided by [OSGeo Oceania](https://osgeo-oceania.org).

This event is hosted by Geogeeks Perth (find us at [Geogeeks Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/geogeeks/shared_invite/zt-13fnotoqb-YkyMTmvwZEB_nDUis_30hw)
