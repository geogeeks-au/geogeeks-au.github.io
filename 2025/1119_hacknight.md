There's just enough time before the Geogeeks Xmas party (stay tuned for the date for that!) to fit in one more **hacknight**!

We'll be meeting in the Town Hall area at Riff, and working on our projects, catching up, and generally being geo and geeky.

Come for a beer and a slice of pizza, bring your laptop and enthusiasm. All skill levels and areas of interest are welcome!

There'll be people working on OpenStreetMap (perhaps focussing on data from [the recent mapping party](https://geogeeks.org/2025/1108_osm-carlisle.html)),
all things QGIS, data collection and processing, and many other aspects of geospatial.

Pizza and drinks will be sponsored by [OSGeo Oceania](https://osgeo-oceania.org).

This event is hosted by Geogeeks Perth (find us at [Geogeeks Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/geogeeks/shared_invite/zt-13fnotoqb-YkyMTmvwZEB_nDUis_30hw)
or [email](mailto:geogeeks.perth@gmail.com)),
and supported by [OSGeo Oceania](https://osgeo-oceania.org)'s grant program and [Spacecubed](https://spacecubed.com).
