Join us for the first Geogeeks meetup of the year! Come for a beer and a slice, bring your projects, and geo-news and let's chat. All skill levels and areas of interest are welcome.

Come to share skills, solve problems, gather inspiration, and help Ben with a semi-automated import of Gabriel's City of Canning footpaths dataset.
There'll be people with interests in OpenStreetMap, all things QGIS, data collection and processing,
and many other aspects of geospatial.

Pizza and drinks are provided by [OSGeo Oceania](https://osgeo-oceania.org).

This event is hosted by Geogeeks Perth (find us at [Geogeeks Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/geogeeks/shared_invite/zt-13fnotoqb-YkyMTmvwZEB_nDUis_30hw)
