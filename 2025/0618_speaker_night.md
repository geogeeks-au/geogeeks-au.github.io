Join us for an evening of lightning talks and great company with the Perth open geospatial community.

We’ve got a fantastic lineup of speakers:

- **Ben Ritter** 🎤 Mapping footpaths in the online OpenStreetMap editor - lessons from [the workshop](https://tasks.smartcitiestransport.com/projects/73)

- **Matt Briggs** 🎤 Classifying lithology from geochemistry data in [Orange Data Mining](https://orangedatamining.com/)

- **Gee Fernando** 🎤 Turn your Python scripts into shareable Geospatial apps with [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/)

- **Georgia Scott** 🎤 Bikes & Maps & Data: opportunities and barriers for active transport advocacy in WA

🍕After the talks, hang around for a casual social over pizza & drinks.

**All are welcome - newcomers, veterans, and the geo-curious alike!**

The event is free, but please register for catering purposes.

Proudly hosted by [Geogeeks Perth][geogeeks], supported by [OSGeo Oceania][osgeo] and [Spacecubed][spacecubed].
